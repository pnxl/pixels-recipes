Water drips from the AC into a bucket under it, the room was quiet but the sound of busy streets that night filled the apartment with noise. Crumbs of food rotted everywhere in the room, mixed with stray pills all over the floor, with alcohol spills everywhere.

The lights weren’t on, and a cracked phone kept buzzing non-stop on the floor, leaving a passed out Chandra in the dark on a used mattress on the floor. He soon regains his vision, feeling his heartbeat pounding in his head, having blurred vision and a horrible migraine. Chandra could barely bring himself to sit up properly, smelling of liquor all over his uniform. His pupils were dilated, still feeling the effects of coke in his bloodstream making his body weak. He could barely feel or control his hands and legs, feeling like the whole room was spinning around. His phone starts to ring again and he grabs it to see whose calling.

“Sam” the white text showed. Chandra kept shaking, slowly pressing the pick up call button.

Chandra drops his phone, still shaking severely and starting to feel lightheaded. He regains strength in his legs, being able to walk to his desk again to drink the leftover cheap booze. The alcohol spilled on his shirt and hardwood floor, just leaving the puddle to sit as he walks back to the bed.

He grabs a small bag of pills from his bedside table, swallowing them while finishing the booze. His body starts to take the effect of the drug, soon passing out in a psychedelic high, forgetting about all his worries and paranoia. But even though he’s using these pills to run away from his worries, something in his body is telling him that tomorrow might be his last.
