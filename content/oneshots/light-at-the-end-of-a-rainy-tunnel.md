title: Light at the End of a Rainy Tunnel
date: 9 January 2023

The rain kept pouring outside of Jason's dorm, with thunder lightly clashing every few minutes. Jason lay in his bed, feeling a slight sense of despair, knowing the rain wouldn't stop until at least nightfall. He reached for his phone on the study desk next to his twin bed and opened his chat with Cinta to text her about canceling their plans to go on a walk together.

"Sorry, Cin. The rain is pretty heavy and won't stop for hours, so we might as well cancel. Maybe next time?" Jason sighed, shifting positions to face the ceiling, filled with disappointment that he wouldn't be able to spend time with an amazing girl. He put his phone back on the table and slowly closed his eyes, intending to sleep off the sound of thunder.

However, just a few seconds after sending that text, frantic knocks on his door jolted Jason into fight-or-flight mode. He got up from his bed and opened the dorm room door. Jason's expression quickly turned to shock as he saw a soaking wet Cinta, holding a broken umbrella. Her light grey coat dripped with rainwater, her hair messy from the wind and rainfall, and she was breathing heavily, as if she had just run inside the dormitory hall from the opposite side of the campus just to visit him.

The two looked at each other, smiling for a few seconds. Cinta raised a plastic bag with warm Chinese takeout she had bought near campus, smiling warmly as if she had forgotten she was just running from a thunderstorm. "Takeout?" Jason immediately invited her in, letting her borrow his hoodie and a pair of shorts while he washed her clothes in his washing machine.

The two sat down, grabbed some chopsticks, and spread out all the food she had bought. Even though they couldn't go on their walk, they were quite satisfied with how the day ended, right next to each other, watching TV while enjoying warm takeout with the sound of rain in the background.
