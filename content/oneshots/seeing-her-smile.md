The night was a shade of denim, with stars peeking through the dark clouds and a full moon blooming in the sky. Jason and Cinta took a detour from their campus path to walk along the beach. The moon provided enough light for them to see the sea from the shore.

"Just take off your shoes, Jas. The sand on your toes is the best part of being at the beach," Cinta said, sitting down on the pavement and removing her shoes and socks. She held onto them and stepped onto the cold, soft grains of sand, playfully kicking it around. She motioned for Jason to do the same.

Jason hesitated but eventually removed his shoes, holding onto them as well. He put one foot on the sandy shore and followed behind Cinta. He had never been a huge fan of beaches, but being alone with Cinta on the beach made him enjoy the moment, especially seeing her smile. They started running around the sand, almost tripping a few times, but couldn't stop laughing the whole time.

Jason joined in, playing around in the sand with Cinta as if they were children, not having a care in the world. They felt like it was just the two of them against the whole world. After a while, they grew tired and sat down by the shore, letting the slow tides wash over their feet. Cinta still wore a warm smile, gazing out at the water. They were too tired to say anything, but they knew that this moment would last.

Cinta decided to rest her head on Jason's shoulder, and he slightly tilted his head towards hers. The sound of water splashing, along with the gentle breeze, sent a chill down their backs. However, being next to each other warmed them, especially when Jason placed his hand on Cinta's waist, keeping each other close.
