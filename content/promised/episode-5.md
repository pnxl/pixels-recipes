Sunlight was peeking through the blinds in Jason’s room, hitting directly above his headboard on pictures of his family and friends stuck on his wall, alongside posters of his favorite bands and musicians. Jason’s alarm sets off as he groans before slightly getting up, not wanting to disturb a sleeping Pixel next to him.

"Hey Google, what time is it?", he said with a raspy voice.

"It's 07:36 A.M.", Google responded.

“Oh fuck, I have morning classes today. At least we finish up early at 12 today, just enough time to prepare for my dinner with Cin at 6.” Jason thought to himself, while slowly tucking Pixel into the blanket.

Jason gets up to pick out a shirt and pants, ending up with his usual black hoodie and jeans. He grabs his backpack and laptop, plus his car keys before making himself a cup of coffee and sending a “good morning” text to the group chat. Jason’s mood was way better that day, driving to his campus while listening to his favorite playlist, and excited to see Cinta walk into class and sit next to him like usual.

It’s been almost 3 weeks since Jason and Cinta reunited, and every single day would be the same routine. Jason would purposely get to class earlier, wait in his usual seat in the very back next to Jovan, pull out his laptop and wait for Cinta. They would occasionally voice call or meet up at the library a few times to study together, even though they would both get distracted and go get coffee or sneak into a classroom at night.

Tonight was their first proper dinner together, which made Jason feel a mix of anxiety and joy.

After a few hours filled with lectures, Jason drives back home immediately, still having 6 more hours to prep. He decides to have a little gaming session with Evan, Jovan, Nicholas and Tristan for around 2 hours before getting ready to cook.

“Alright guys I gotta go bye” Jason says, before leaving the voicechat and getting up to the kitchen.

Prepping took longer than he had expected, since he prepared wine glasses with coke, a few side dishes and dessert to end the night, alongside the pasta for two. He finally set the table aswell, with his fancy silverware set that he never opened which he received from his mother. After a few hours, he manages to complete everything with just 20 minutes left before Cinta comes over. He gets ready and picks out a good shirt to use, and takes out the molten lava cakes from the oven.

Shortly after, the door bell rings. Perfect timing!

“Hey, sorry if I’m a bit early, I was rushing because I knew traffic was going to be a nightmare around this time.” Cinta walked in the room, wearing a short light pink dress with puff sleeves.

“Woah, you look stunning, Cin.”, Jason mentioned.

“Oh haha, thanks!” Cinta responded.

The two had a wonderful dinner, and Jason soon felt safe, slowly losing the feeling of anxiety he had before she walked in the room. It had only been 3 weeks, but Jason was sure he wanted to ask about the promise again. Will she remember?

The two finished their side dishes and pasta, having enough room for Jason’s classic lava cake which he warmed up, plated with maraschino cherries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and topped off with a sprig of mint. The two kept saying they were full and yet devoured the whole thing, all while laughing and reminiscing their old middle school and highschool memories.

After a while, Jason sighed and his heart paced a bit faster. He had to ask her, right?

Jason: “Cin, do you remember the promise we made in eight grade?”

Cinta: “What promise? We liked to make a lot of joke promises so I didn’t keep track.”

Jason: “The promise of well, us trying something. A relationship of some sort that we never had when we were younger?”

Cinta: “Oh, that; I remember that. Why do you ask?”

Jason: “Cin, the reason for this dinner is that, well, I wanted to just try again. I know we’ve only reunited for 3 weeks, but I really think it’s a good chance to try again.”

Jason: “I really like you and feel like we can understand each other, like old times. I just want to make sure you’re okay with it. The promise stated if we were 18 and I still had feelings for you, I would chase after you, and I think I do. I know this is a lot to ask but…”

Jason: “Will you be mine?”
