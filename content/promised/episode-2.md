title: Do You Remember?

"How long has it been? I feel like it's been ages since we last spoke," Cinta remarked as she settled down next to Jason, arranging her laptop and textbook on the table. Her sweet smile, reminiscent of their time in middle school, adorned her face. Jason was taken aback, his mouth slightly agape, wanting to respond but unable to tear his gaze away from her captivating smile.

"It's been about 3 years since we last saw each other. We were in the same class from 8th grade but drifted apart in 10th grade," Jason replied, his voice tinged with nostalgia. He couldn't help but maintain a gentle smile as he looked at Cinta, inadvertently gazing at her for a few minutes. Eventually, he shifted his focus to his own work, but found it difficult to absorb any of the lecture's content.
