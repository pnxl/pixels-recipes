“I don’t even know what to cook her. She told me pasta and Italian food were her favorites but I don’t cook Italian that often.” Jason says, grabbing a pack of frozen peas and placing it in the cart. “What about ramen or something?” Evan asked while pushing the cart around.

“That’s too basic. I’m not gonna cook her instant ramen for dinner.”

“Jas, remember that vegetarian bolognese recipe I sent you at 3 am? It’s Italian, maybe you can cook that instead” Nadine said, texting Dhenia with one hand and grabbing a plastic bag filled with tomatoes in the other.

Jason: “Oh that, I didn’t see it. I was finishing up on some homework. Can you resend me the recipe?”

Nadine: “Cari sendiri. The link is in our DMs.”

Jason: “You're annoying.”

Nadine: “Ngaca!”

Jason and the 2 grabbed all the ingredients needed and their groceries, parting ways after around an hour of looking through produce, cleaning products and snacks. Jason soon drove home to his dorm, grabbing all his bags and shutting the car trunk.

Jason sighed after finally getting back to his room, laying on his bed for a few minutes, petting his pet poodle, Pixel, before getting up to eat some leftovers for dinner and feeding his dog. He walked back to his room to code a bit before going to bed early, as he jams to Fiji Blue.

After 2 hours, he shut down his laptop and got ready for bed, showered and brushed his teeth before grabbing his phone and laying on his bed.
