“Will you be mine?”

Jason’s heart was pounding in his chest, slowly breathing in and out to calm down and wait for Cinta’s response. Even with music in the background, the moment those words came out of Jason’s mouth, the atmosphere felt sliced.

Cinta was speechless, she tried to process what he had just said. For 17 seconds straight, Jason and Cinta both stayed silent, waiting for one or the other to say a single word to break the tension. Soon enough, one of them spoke, but instead of breaking the tension, they shattered it.

“No.” Cinta looked at Jason, keeping eye contact but looking upset because she of shock.

“I-I-I’m, just, no. I can’t do this. I’m sorry.” Cinta kept stuttering in a panic, and immediately grabbed her purse.

“Wait!” Jason said, grabbing Cinta’s wrist.

“I’m sorry, it was really sudden but I couldn’t hold it back. I just wanted to see if I had a chance. Please don’t run away.” Jason said desperately, knowing that how Cinta reacted could easily break their friendship. Cinta was about to reach for the door, and without a single glance to Jason, she said in a stern tone “Let go.”

Jason’s heart dropped, as if it had shattered into a million pieces. Jason’s grip loosened, allowing Cinta to whisk away out the door as if she was a piece of silk flowing in the wind and flying away following the breeze. Jason couldn’t speak, couldn’t react and couldn’t think. Tears struck down his eyes, and all he could do was let them rain down silently. He placed his palms on his face, feeling disappointment, sadness, and regret.

Did he lose her? Is this the end of their reconciliation? Is this really their goodbye? Their end?

Jason slowly rised from his seat and went back to his room, slamming the door and fell asleep under his blue lights. His tears didn’t stop, leaving red marks the day after. He couldn’t handle it, he was heartbroken. He lost her again after years of growing distant.

Will there be a light at the end of the tunnel for him?
