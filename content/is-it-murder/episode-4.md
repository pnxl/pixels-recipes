Strict, sharp-tongued, honest, prominent. Kathy was far from lazy. Innocent until proven guilty? That was far from what she believed. Kathy believed all defendants are guilty until proven innocent, taking her job to extreme lengths to protect a client. Her determination was unbeatable, soon becoming the best lawyer of the city, but she still strived for perfection, wanting to earn the title of “best lawyer in the country”.

The law always intrigued her, how humanity can follow rules intricately designed for peace. Her interests bloomed around the age of 9, finding a book about the psychology and analysis behind different crimes throughout her country’s history in her parent’s study. That one book was enough to make her sure of her future. A lawyer - that was all she wanted to be, doing everything she could to accomplish it. Debate club president, member of the student council, top of her class, spelling bee champion, unbeaten science fair winner. She aimed for the top, following in her sister, Shaylynn’s academic footsteps and achieving more.

She made a mark in her family’s history, being the first to skip multiple grades and reaching new heights academically. She was the first to succeed in achieving her dreams, being the pride of the family. But with great power comes great responsibility. “Sorry guys, I can’t make it to the party, I’m close to getting a huge case from my firm. Maybe next time.” Insomnia, caffeine, books everywhere, zero time.

Kathy had thought of giving up before, but she couldn’t let herself down. She didn’t run away to alcohol or smoking like her siblings, but instead with sleeping pills. She had insomnia because of the amount of time she dedicates to studying and reviewing cases. She relied on sleeping pills for rest, but never overdosing because she knew the effects of it. She never grew an addiction, but her body needed it just so she could at least rest her head for a while.

“Nothing bad would happen if I took these pills again, right?” Sighing as she swallows the pills with water before slowly closing her eyes.
