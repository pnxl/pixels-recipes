It was already 9 in the morning and everyone was in their own rooms. Jason was still in the kitchen writing down some meal plans for the next week and making a grocery list. Meanwhile, Cinta finally woke up and ate the pancakes Jason had saved for her.

“Morning love. Anything interesting happened last night?” Jason asked, still writing in his journal and taking glances at a sleepy Cinta.

“Not much, just the usual catching up at that resto we used to eat at.” Cinta soon finished up and washed the dishes before kissing Jason’s cheek and going back to her room.

They had a date planned for that afternoon, so Jason had to assign chores to everyone and give the grocery list to Nadine.

“Sunday breakfast: Make everyone breakfast sandwiches with eggs, ham, cheese, chives, butter, salt & pepper. Buy orange and apple juice.” He closed his journal and placed it between the other recipe books on the table and went to Nadine’s room to give her the grocery list. “Nad, here’s the grocery list for today, as well as the cash from the grocery jar. Please don’t overbuy and get some snacks for movie night tonight.”

Nadine was laying in bed listening to music, still in her pajamas. “Alright. Can I invite Kathy and Evan too? Their schedules today aren’t filled, and I need some help bringing the groceries back.” Jason just nodded and reminded her to bring the coupons to save some money. Jason checked up on Shay, who was getting ready for brunch with some friends from an organization she joined on campus.

“Another brunch meeting? Is that why you didn’t eat much during breakfast?”

“Yeah, it’s been hell week in campus because of the multiple events being held this month. You don’t have to make me a plate at lunch, I won’t be home till 6.”

“Okay, I’ll tell the others about your absence.”

“Thanks, Jas. I’ll be back by dinner.”

Jason closed the door and went to check everyone’s shared calendar. He added a few new details and told everyone in the groupchat that lunch will be fried rice with eggs and some fruit, since all that was left in the fridge were just leftover rice, eggs, veggies and some chicken. He also reminded Nadine to get ingredients for pasta since he’ll be making his recipe for dinner. He also assigned everyone’s chores for the day and decided to get back to bed to rest a bit.
