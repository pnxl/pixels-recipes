title: Time for Breakfast!
date: 21 June 2023

5.45 in the morning. Everyone was still passed out as the sun had barely risen. It was Saturday morning, so everyone had been drained from the night before studying or out with friends. Jason woke up in his dark room next to a passed out Cinta who was out late with Celyn and Jenni after months of not meeting up. He didn't bother to wake her up and decided to get out of bed, brush his teeth, and get breakfast ready for everyone.

Despite being up very early, Jason saw Kathy already awake, reading a book by the kitchen island with a hot cup of tea. He passed a sleeping Nadine on the couch with a blanket over her, snoring as if she hadn't slept in days. Nadine was busy editing that night and didn't bother to sleep in her room, falling asleep on the couch with her laptop next to her. Shay and Evan were both in their own rooms, being the only ones who slept properly last night (though Shaylynn slept late last night to review some case studies her professor had assigned).

"Morning, Jas," Kathy said, not even bothering to look up from her book. "Morning, Kat." Jason instantly went to check the fridge to see what they need for their 2-week grocery day that Nadine is in charge of. There wasn't much left, but it was enough to feed everyone for breakfast and lunch. He grabbed some pancake mix and leftover berries that he hid away from Nadine to make berry pancakes for everyone. He also grabbed some eggs to make sunny-side-up eggs as well as bacon.

Not long after, Nadine woke up and got up to grab some milk. It was around 6.10 when Jason was almost done with breakfast. Kathy and Nadine joked around while waiting patiently for breakfast to be ready. 6.30, "Guys, time for breakfast!" Jason yelled. Shay got out of her room looking refreshed while Evan came out of his room slightly sluggish. Cinta was the only one still asleep but Jason allowed her to get some more rest, saving some pancakes for her later.

Everyone went to the dining table and ate together, discussing classes and so on. By 7.30, everyone had eaten and went back to their rooms to chill or get ready.
