title: Grocery Day!
date: 26 June 2023

“Kat, Van, you guys wanna join me to go grocery shopping right now?” Nadine walked out of her room in a simple black tee and a black and white plaid skirt and a small purse. “Sure, let me go change real quick.” Kathy said. She was still in pj’s since she didn’t have any plans that day but changed into a plain shirt with a blue sweater with some black pants. “Sure, I’ve got nothing to do ‘til 2 anyways.” Evan was just wearing a normal shirt with shorts but changed his pants to longer ones and a hoodie.

After everyone changed, Nadine grabbed her car keys and said goodbye to Jason, Cinta, and Shay before leaving. “Be back before lunch, guys.” It usually takes Nadine more or less 10 minutes to drive to the grocery store and can spend from 30 minutes to an hour picking produce and everyday items. “Why did you decide to wear something so fancy, Nad.” Kathy asked while adjusting her seatbelt in the front seat. “I’m going out for coffee with some friends later after lunch, might as well not change since I’ll stay to eat with you guys then leave.”

After 10 minutes, everyone gets out, and Kathy and Evan talk behind Nadine who's already grabbing a shopping cart. Nadine instantly went to the produce section to buy the fruits and vegetables Jason asked for, picking out some fruit for her to enjoy alone as well. Meanwhile, Evan and Kathy were both sent to get dairy and snacks, coming back with a mountain of chips, candy, and treats, along with some milk and yogurt. 20 minutes had passed, much faster than whenever Nadine would go alone with the help of Kathy and Evan. All they needed was to get different cuts of meat. Pork, beef, poultry, seafood, all of it.

By the time they got to the cashier, Nadine spent all the coupons Jason gave her and some of her own coupons she had collected. The total was not as high as Nadine expected, bringing joy knowing the coupons were beneficial. They all packed up the groceries and went back to the apartment, smelling a familiar scent as they unlocked the door and walked in. “Hey, you guys were much earlier than expected. Lunch isn’t ready yet. You guys just go change first. It’ll be ready in 10 minutes.” Jason was cooking some fried rice for lunch, with Cinta helping him with cutting up some melons and pineapple for the table.

“I’ll organize all the groceries, Jas. Also, here’s the receipt. By the way, after lunch, I’m going out for some coffee with Bri, Jay, and Bert. I’ll be back at around 3 if you need anything.” Nadine started unpacking all the grocery bags and put all of them away. After a few minutes, everyone gathered around the table for lunch. As always, everyone had a good time and enjoyed the moment, even if it only lasts a few minutes.
