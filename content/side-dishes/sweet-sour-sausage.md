title: Cigarette Burns All Over Her Coat
---

Sharp, successful, calm, perfect. Shaylynn was never described with a single insult. Being the oldest in the family, she was always the one who had to deal with the chaos. Their parents spent their time in bars, clubs, anywhere except home. They had a maid, but she was only there for cooking and cleaning, while Shaylynn had to take care of her younger siblings.

Even though she had to take care of 4 kids and herself, she never lost her patience. She was the top in her class and got into a reputable Ivy League university. She graduated in her early twenties and immediately started a big project of hers, building a hotel.

After several years, it wasn’t long before the hotel became a huge hit. Countless high-profile clients in and out those doors, hundreds of events costing a fortune daily. After 2 years of the hotel being open, Shaylynn made millions. Soon enough, Shaylynn got married at 24, giving birth to twins a few months after and purchasing a beautiful modern mansion alongside her husband.

Shaylynn never talked about her marriage. It wasn’t miserable, but it wasn’t the picture-perfect family either. For the first year of having twins, Shaylynn became a stay-at-home mom, letting a cousin of hers run the hotel in her absence. In the second year, Shaylynn hired a nanny and mostly came home late, sometimes on time for dinner alone while her husband was in the hospital.

Her husband was a neurosurgeon, making the time they spent together very limited. Many people wonder how Shaylynn is always so calm and collected. The answer is: her cigarettes. She started smoking when she was 18, finding a case of cigarettes her mom had kept. On her 18th birthday, a few weeks after her parent’s "murder," she received a lighter from her aunt. It belonged to her mother, which led to Shaylynn smoking the stress away.

She often found herself in the bathroom with a cigarette, or late at night, smoking on her balcony. It wasn’t healthy, and she knew that. But, she kept smoking, only openly smoking to her siblings. Behind being a perfect mother, a successful hotel owner, and a model citizen, being one of the most successful women in the country, she was still just a 17-year-old girl, cigarette burns all over her coat, wanting to just cry her eyes out after going through the pain of hiding a huge incident.
